# Exercises 6.3-6.18: Anecdotes

An updated version of the [Anecdote app from Part 1](https://github.com/brandonmpark/full-stack-open-submissions/tree/main/Part1/Anecdotes) using Redux for state management, along with some extra features.

I chose to skip exercises 6.19-6.21 for the sake of time, as I likely won't be using `connect` instead of hooks anytime in the near future.

# Usage

1. Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/brandonmpark/full-stack-open-submissions.git`
2. Navigate to project: `cd full-stack-open-submissions/part6/anecdotes`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
